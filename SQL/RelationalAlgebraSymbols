NO DUPLICATES~~~~~


unary operators
𝜎		Selection			rows

π		Projection			columns

𝒢 (calligraphic G)	 or	𝛄   (gamma)	 for grouping with 	Aggregate function

example	gamma a; count(*)->x ( R )
order the result by the first column (default is ascending) 
and the second column descending:  γ a, b ; sum(c)->x ( Customer )

(NOTE:  If no grouping, then the entire table is the group)


binary operators
			unions

⋃		Union 

⋂		Intersection


			mathematical
＋
－
×
÷

=

<
<=

>
>=



-		Difference, Set difference

×		Product, Cartesian Product.  Used OFTEN when looking at multiple tables

÷		Division

		
𝜌 	𝝔	rename (rho)

τ	τ	order by (tau) 	asc	desc		example	tau a asc, b desc ( R )



			Joins

		inner join   join
⨝		Natural join		join		
⨝ condition		 𝚹  Theta join (same as natural join but with a  ⨝ condition)  
				if the condition is = then it's an equijoin
			
		outer join
⟕	⟕	Left outer join	left join
⟖	⟖	Right outer join	right join

⟗	⟗	Full outer join


Logical symbols
¬	￢		∧	∧		∨  	∨
NOT			AND			OR
